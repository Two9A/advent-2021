# Advent of Code 2021, but I'm learning Python

It's high time I learned Python, honestly.

For each of the 50 stars, I'll be looking to build a one-file solution that's
at least halfway readable Python3. Any stumbling points I run into or places
where I end up with the wrong answer, I'll try to comment specifically.
